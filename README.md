# AlienInvasionGame


In this game, the player controls the rocket ship at the bottom center of the screen. The Player can move the shift left and right using the arrow keys, and can shoot bullets using the space bar. At the beginning of the game, there is a fleet of aliens that move across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys aliens, and if they shoot all the aliens, a new flight appears and moves faster than the previous fleet. If an alien hits the rocket ship or the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship (life). If the player loses 3 ships, the game ends.
